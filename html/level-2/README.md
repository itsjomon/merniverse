## Semantic Markup

It is the markup that relates to the meaning of content.

| Semantic tags          | Non-Semantic tags    |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| `<header></header>`    | `<div></div>`        |
| `<main></main>`        | `<span></span>`, etc |
| `<footer></footer>`    |                      |
| `<nav></nav>`          |                      |
| `<article></article>`  |                      |
| `<section></section>`  |                      |
| `<aside></aside>`, etc |                      |

- Semantic tags are used to give meaning to the content they contain, making it easier for both developers and browsers to understand the structure and purpose of the content.
- Non-semantic tags do not provide any information about the content they contain, they are used purely for layout and styling purposes.

## Entities

- An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;).
- Used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces).
- Can also use in place of characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.
- Browser interprets them and renders the correct character.

E.g., Love symbol `&hearts;`
